## Grading (95 points + 5 points evals)
## Score: 88/95

1. *Project Scope:*  10

2. *Background and motivation:* 10

3. *Data description:* 9

- sample size?

4. *Methodology:* 10

5. *Implementation:* 9

- last graph won't load

6. *Discussion/interpretation of results:* 9

- would be more informative if you included a results tab that had your "best" predictive method and most informative predictors of league. You give a lot of EDA and the user might want to know which predictors look most important. 

7. *Coding style and quality:* 10

8. *Presentation:* 8

- some of the boxplots should have a non-linear scale due to outliers/extreme skewness
- why use color in the age boxplots but not league?
- the y-axis scale on your predictive graph should be fixed from 0-1, otherwise you can't easily make comparison using height when changing predictive method

9. *Submission:* 9

- two repos in the class organization

The following aspects will be graded on a 5-point scale:

10. *Creativity:* 4

- Nice webpage
